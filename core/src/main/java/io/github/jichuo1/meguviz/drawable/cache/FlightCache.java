/**
 * A bounded cache of expensive, pure results with single-flight production, meant to be shared by
 * many owners (for example every scene that needs the same background tile).
 *
 * <p><b>Lookup is never a computation.</b> {@link #peek} and the hit path of {@link #request} only
 * read memory, so a draw path can use them on the owner thread; a miss is turned into work for the
 * supplied {@link Executor} instead of being done inline. {@link #computeNow} exists for the one case
 * that must be exact and synchronous (an export), and it deliberately never waits for the executor.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>One flight per key.</b> Concurrent requests for a missing key join the same flight: the
 * producer runs once, off any lock, and the result is cached and delivered to every subscriber that
 * is still interested. The first requester's producer runs, so equal keys must mean equal inputs.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Subscribers are owner-confined and generation-checked.</b> A {@link Subscriber} is called on
 * the owner thread through the {@link OwnerPoster}, and only if it was not cancelled and still says
 * {@link Subscriber#isCurrent()} when the delivery runs; a result nobody wants any more is still
 * cached but not delivered. {@link Ticket#cancel} and every callback run on the owner thread, so a
 * cancelled subscriber is never called after {@code cancel} returned.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Abandoned work does not pile up.</b> A flight that lost all its subscribers before it started
 * is dropped when its turn comes (and removed from a {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} queue at once), and
 * it is the first thing to give way when the flight limit is reached; a new request for the same key
 * revives it. A flight that already started finishes: its result is shared pure work and is cached,
 * unless {@link Builder#abandonRunning} asks the producer to stop at its next
 * {@link Cancellation} check.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Bounds.</b> Entries and total weight are capped (least recently used goes first), and so is
 * the number of live flights; past the flight limit {@link #request} answers
 * {@link Status#REJECTED_CAPACITY} instead of queuing without limit. The cache never recycles a value
 * on eviction, because the evicted value may still be on screen; use the
 * {@link EvictionListener} to release resources the owner knows are free.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances are thread-safe. Values must be immutable once produced.</p>

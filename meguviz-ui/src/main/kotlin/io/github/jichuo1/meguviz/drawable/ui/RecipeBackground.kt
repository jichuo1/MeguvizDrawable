 * A [DrawingRecipe] kept on a View background through MeguvizUI's property system.
 *
 * MeguvizUI decides *when* a write happens (frame scheduling, coalescing, and the attach, rebind,
 * theme and resource epochs that make a pending write stale). This class decides *what* a write
 * does, using the drawable ownership rules:
 * - an equal recipe is skipped by the property binding, and a repeated write of the same recipe at
 *   the same density keeps the installed drawable instead of building another;
 * - if business code replaces the background, the next write neither overwrites it nor pretends it
 *   still owns it: [isOwned] turns false until [reclaim] is called;
 * - releasing the View, rebinding it, or closing the session closes this object, which clears the
 *   background only if it is still the one installed here.
 *
 * Binding is the act of claiming the property: the first write replaces whatever background the View
 * has, the way a MeguvizUI property write always does. Owner (main) thread only, like the rest of
 * MeguvizUI.
